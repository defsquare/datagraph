# @defsquare/data-graph

jsoncrack-style visualization for complex objects — aggregates and entities,
with real reference edges — rendered on a Pixi.js canvas. See the
[root README](https://github.com/defsquare/data-graph#readme) for the full
pitch, entity/reference config format, public API table, themes, and
performance budgets.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @defsquare/data-graph
```

## Quickstart

```ts
import { createDataGraph } from "@defsquare/data-graph";

const shopData = {
  customers: [
    { id: "c1", name: "Dupont", email: "dupont@example.com",
      address: { street: "1 rue de la Paix", city: "Paris" } },
    { id: "c2", name: "Martin", email: "martin@example.com" },
  ],
  orders: [
    { id: "o1", customerId: "c1", total: 99.5,
      lines: [{ sku: "A-1", qty: 2 }, { sku: "B-7", qty: 1 }] },
    { id: "o2", customerId: "GHOST", total: 12 },
  ],
};

const shopConfig = {
  entities: {
    Customer: { match: "$.customers[*]", id: "id" },
    Order: { match: "$.orders[*]", id: "id" },
  },
  references: { Order: { customerId: "Customer" } },
};

const container = document.getElementById("app")!;

const graph = createDataGraph(container, {
  data: shopData,
  config: shopConfig,
  elkWorkerUrl: new URL("elkjs/lib/elk-worker.min.js", import.meta.url),
});

await graph.ready;
graph.fit();

graph.on("select", (node) => console.log("selected:", node.label));
```

`createDataGraph` returns a `DataGraph` handle with `fit`, `expand`,
`collapse`, `focus`, `select`, `search`, `nextMatch`, `prevMatch`, `on`,
`setData`, `diagnostics`, `stats`, `refEdges`, `setTheme`, and `destroy` —
full descriptions in the
[root README's API table](https://github.com/defsquare/data-graph#public-api--datagraph).

## Navigation

| Gesture | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Two-finger swipe (trackpad) | Pan |
| Pinch (trackpad) | Zoom at the cursor |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom at the cursor |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + wheel | Zoom at the cursor |
| Click and drag | Pan |

Trackpad pinch and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+wheel are the same browser event, so both
are always recognised as zoom. Telling a plain mouse wheel apart from a
two-finger swipe is a heuristic — a wheel arrives as large, whole-numbered,
purely vertical steps, a swipe as a stream of small and often fractional
deltas with some horizontal component. A very fast, perfectly vertical swipe
can therefore be read as a wheel and zoom instead of panning. The threshold is
deliberately set high so this stays rare.

Zoom is bounded to `[0.02, 3]`. `fit()` never scales past `1` — magnifying a
bitmap-font atlas baked at its nominal size is what made text look soft — so a
graph smaller than the viewport is centred rather than blown up.

## Themes

Ships four built-in themes — `defsquareLight` (default), `defsquareDark`,
`neutralLight`, `neutralDark` — plus `resolveTheme(partial?, base?)`,
`entityAccentMap(entityTypes, theme)`, and a `ThemeOverride` type for
per-instance customization.

```ts
import { createDataGraph, defsquareDark, resolveTheme } from "@defsquare/data-graph";

// Partial override: any token not mentioned comes from defsquareLight.
const graph = createDataGraph(container, {
  data: shopData,
  config: shopConfig,
  theme: {
    accent: { selection: "#0ea5e9" },
    byEntityType: { Customer: { accent: "#3dbf9e" } },
  },
});

// Full swap to the dark theme, live.
graph.setTheme(defsquareDark);

// Or a variant of the dark theme.
graph.setTheme(resolveTheme({ surface: { canvas: "#000000" } }, defsquareDark));
```

`Theme` is grouped by role rather than a flat color bag: `surface.{canvas,card,cardMuted}`,
`ink.{primary,muted,subtle}`, `accent.{entity,selection,match,matchStroke}`,
`edge.{contain,ref,dangling,hairline,border}`, `typography.{header,badge,key,value}`
(each a `{family,size,weight,tracking?}`), `radii.{card}`,
`strokes.{border,edge,selection,match,matchCurrent}`, `entityPalette: string[]`,
an optional `byEntityType: Record<string, { accent: string }>`, and `fonts.{body,mono}`.
`theme` in `createDataGraph`'s options is a `ThemeOverride` — any subset of
that shape. `resolveTheme(partial?, base?)` performs the merge (one level
deep per group, onto `base`, default `defsquareLight`); it's what
`createDataGraph` and `setTheme` call internally, and you can call it
yourself to build a variant of a specific built-in theme, as above.

`setTheme(theme)` swaps the theme on a live instance and redraws
immediately. It does **not** re-run layout or re-measure fonts — safe for
toggling between themes that share `typography`/`fonts` (any light/dark pair
shipped here), but not for changing those two groups themselves; that
requires a fresh `createDataGraph`. It merges through `resolveTheme` against
the theme currently in effect, so a `byEntityType` set earlier survives a
plain light/dark swap unless the new call overrides it.

See the [root README](https://github.com/defsquare/data-graph#themes) for
more on the theme/config relationship.
